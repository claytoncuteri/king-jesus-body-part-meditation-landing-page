# ConvertKit Integration Setup

Your King Jesus Meditation landing page uses ConvertKit for email automation and product delivery. Follow these steps to complete the setup:

## Required Environment Variables

You've already added:
- ‚úÖ `CONVERTKIT_API_KEY` - Your ConvertKit API Key
- ‚úÖ `CONVERTKIT_API_SECRET` - Your ConvertKit API Secret

### Additional Required Variables

You need to add two more environment variables:

1. **`CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID`** - Your ConvertKit Form ID for lead capture
2. **`CONVERTKIT_PURCHASE_TAG_ID`** - Your ConvertKit Tag ID for product delivery automation

### How to Get Your Form ID

1. Log in to your ConvertKit dashboard
2. Go to "Grow" ‚Üí "Landing Pages & Forms"
3. Select the form you want to use for King Jesus Meditation leads
4. The Form ID is in the URL: `https://app.convertkit.com/forms/designers/[FORM_ID]/edit`
5. Add this as a secret in Replit: `CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID=[your-form-id]`

### How to Get Your Tag ID

1. In ConvertKit, go to "Grow" ‚Üí "Tags"
2. Create a new tag called "Product Purchased - King Jesus Meditation" (or click on existing one)
3. The Tag ID is in the URL: `https://app.convertkit.com/subscribers/tags/[TAG_ID]`
4. Add this as a secret in Replit: `CONVERTKIT_PURCHASE_TAG_ID=[your-tag-id]`

## Email Automation Setup

For product delivery emails to work automatically, you need to set up an automation in ConvertKit:

### Create Purchase Automation

1. In ConvertKit, go to "Automate" ‚Üí "Visual Automations"
2. Create a new automation
3. **Trigger**: When a subscriber is tagged with "Product Purchased - King Jesus Meditation"
4. **Action**: Send an email with the following content:

```
Subject: üôè Your King Jesus Meditation Package - Divine Transformation Awaits!

5. Save and activate the automation

## How It Works

1. **Email Capture**: When someone enters their email on the landing page, they're added to your ConvertKit form (using `CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID`)
2. **Purchase Flow**: When someone completes a purchase via Stripe:
   - They're automatically tagged with "Product Purchased - King Jesus Meditation" (using `CONVERTKIT_PURCHASE_TAG_ID`)
   - Your ConvertKit automation triggers based on this tag
   - They receive the email with all product links
3. **Error Handling**: If product delivery fails, the system logs critical errors for manual follow-up

## Testing

1. Make a test purchase with your own email
2. Check that you receive the automation email
3. Verify all download links work correctly

## Important Notes

- Make sure to replace `[Your Video Link]`, `[Your Podcast Link]`, etc. with actual links to your digital products
- You can upload PDFs and videos to Replit's Object Storage or host them on a service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or a dedicated digital product platform
- Test the entire flow before launching to ensure customers receive their products immediately
